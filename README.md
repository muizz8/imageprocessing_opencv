# Image Processing with OpenCV üñºÔ∏è

Welcome to the Image Processing with OpenCV repository! This project utilizes Python along with the OpenCV library to perform various image processing tasks. Whether you're a beginner looking to explore the fundamentals of image manipulation or an experienced developer seeking to integrate advanced image processing techniques into your projects, this repository provides a solid foundation to get started.

## Features üåü

- **Basic Image Manipulation:** Resize, crop, rotate, and flip images.
- **Filters and Enhancements:** Apply filters like blur, sharpen, and edge detection. Enhance images with adjustments such as brightness, contrast, and saturation.
- **Object Detection:** Detect objects and features in images using techniques like Haar cascades and deep learning-based models.
- **Image Segmentation:** Segment images into meaningful regions using techniques like thresholding, contour detection, and watershed algorithm.
- **Video Processing:** Process video streams, apply filters, and perform real-time object detection and tracking.

## Dependencies üõ†Ô∏è

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV

You can install OpenCV using pip:

```
pip install opencv-python
```

## Usage üöÄ

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/imageprocessing_opencv.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd imageprocessing_opencv
   ```
3. Run the Python scripts located in the `scripts` directory to perform various image processing tasks. Feel free to explore and modify the scripts according to your requirements.
